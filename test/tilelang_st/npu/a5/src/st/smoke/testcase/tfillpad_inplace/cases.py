"""Single source of truth for tfillpad_inplace ST test cases.

Matches C++ reference test case: Case 5

Each case defines:
  - name:        case identifier
  - dtype:       numpy dtype
  - shape:       (rows, cols) — tile dimensions (physical buffer size)
  - valid_shape: (valid_rows, valid_cols) — valid region (smaller than shape)
  - eps:         tolerance for numpy.allclose
